# Guitar_Price_Predictor
This project is designed to develop an deep learning model to predict the resale value of second-hand acoustic guitars from images.

In a marketplace as varied as the one for second-hand musical instruments, where the condition and brand significantly influence price, it's common to encounter uncertainty regarding fair market values. Our project was inspired by the eclectic mix of offerings on platforms such as Facebook Marketplace, which highlighted the need for a reliable pricing guide for both buyers and sellers.

We set out to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a deep learning model that evaluates images to recommend fair prices for second-hand musical instruments. Our user-friendly tool empowers sellers with price suggestions at a photo's snap. For buyers, it serves as a swift evaluator, assessing whether an instrument's listed price reflects its true market value based on visual analysis. This project promises to bring clarity and confidence to the buying and selling process, ensuring that value resonates with every transaction.
